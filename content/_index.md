# Welcome developers !

As creators, citizens, non-profits or companies, we all increasingly
share the same desire to take action to build a better world: one that
is more diverse, more sustainable and open to all. But how does one
turn an idea into reality?

Ulule helps creators take the plunge and, more importantly, turn it into
a success! Besides the financing aspect, Ulule supports its creators
throughout this process by helping them make their ideas a reality,
co-create with their communities, spread the word about their projects
and make them grow.

A crowdfunding pioneer since 2010, Ulule has become the leading
community-backed incubator of positive impact projects. To date, our
community of almost 3 million members has brought 30,000 projects to
life.
