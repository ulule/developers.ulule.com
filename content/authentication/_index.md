# Authentication

In most of the cases, data that is publicly readable on the Ulule website is also readable via Ulule API without authentication.

However, to read private data or to write data, requests must be authenticated.

There are three ways to authenticate through the API.

* HTTP Basic
* API key
* OAuth2

To read private data, HTTP Basic and API key are usually enough. To write data, OAuth2 is required.
