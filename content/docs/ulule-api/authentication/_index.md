# Authentication

In most cases, data that is publicly readable on the Ulule website is also readable via Ulule API without authentication.

However, to read private data or to write data, requests must be authenticated.

There are three methods to authenticate requests.

* HTTP Basic
* API key
* OAuth2

To read private data, the HTTP Basic and API key methods may be used. To write data, the OAuth2 method is required.
