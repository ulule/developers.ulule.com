# I18n

Some payloads and resources contain fields of type `i18n object`. An i18n object is a JSON object that contains i18n translations. Object keys are language codes (see [supported languages](#languages)), and object values are translation strings.

For example, the `description` field of the [user resource](#user) field may look like this:

```json
{
    "en": "This is the description in english",
    "fr": "Ceci est la description en français"
}
```

In order to get all the translations of an i18n field in the resource, the query string parameter `lang=all` must be specified in the URL for the three `GET`, `POST` and `PATCH` HTTP methods.

```bash
$ curl "https://api.ulule.com/v1/users/105478?lang=all"
```

```json
{
    "description": {
        "en": "This is a description in english",
        "fr": "Ceci est une description en français",
        "it": "Questo è descritto in italiano",
        "de": "",
        "ca": "",
        "es": ""
    }
}
```

If the parameter ``lang`` is not specified in the URL, the resource returned contains the translation for the parent object lang and the translations present in the request payload.

Let's take an example project which main language is `en`, if you update a reward with the following payload:

```json
{
    "description": {
        "fr": "ma superbe description"
    }
}
```

The returned resource will have the `description` field in two languages:

* `en` because it is the parent resource main language
* `fr` because it is provided in the request payload

```json
{
    "description": {
        "en": "my awesome description",
        "fr": "ma superbe description"
    }
}
```
