      <description>Versions Ulule API has a versioning system to manage upgrades without breaking backward-compatibility.
The API version controls the API observable behavior, for example the fields present in resources, etc.
When we must introduce a backward-incompatible change, we release a new version named after the current date. To avoid breaking external programs, these versions are always opt-in and must be explicitely requested.
To request a specific version, add the Ulule-Version HTTP header to the request.</description>
